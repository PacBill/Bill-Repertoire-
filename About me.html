		<p> I am a First-Year Bachelor of Science in Information Technology student at <a href="https://thelewiscollege.edu.ph/" target="_blank">
			<strong><em>The Lewis College.</strong></em></a> A future Meteorologist and I.T. professional, I am currently practicing and honing my 
			skills in the fields of <strong>Meteorology</strong> and <strong>Information Technology</strong>.<br><br>
			In the future, I would like to make and design an application software that will focus on Weather Forcasting. This app, a Weather Diary, 
			will be a useful tool in predicting and montoring the weather phenomenon, with precise accuracy, in a certain area. The weather diary 
			will help, and save, millions of people, particularly in the Philippines, in the harshest times of a weather inclement.<br><br><br>
			For that to happen, I have to comply all the requirements that The Lewis College has set to its I.T. Students. Here are the major I.T.
			subjects that I have to pass:
			<ul>
				<li>Introduction to Computing</li>
					<ol>
						<li>Introduction to HyperText Markup Language (HTML)</li>
						<li>Introduction to Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</li>
					</ol>
				<li>Programming 1</li>
					<ol>
						<li>Python Program</li>
					</ol>
				<li>Computer Systems Servicing</li>
					<ol>
						<li>Assembling the System Unit</li>
						<li>Disassebling the System Unit</li>
					</ol>
			</ul><br>
			However, The Lewis College has added 5 minor subjects to pass the semester. Here are the 5 minor subjects that every I.T. student at 
			The Lewis College has to comply:
					<ol>
						<li>Masining sa Pagpapahayag</li>
						<li>National Service Training Program (NSTP)</li>
						<li>Readings in the Philippine History</li>
						<li>Self Activities</li>
						<li>Understanding the Self</li>
					</ol>
